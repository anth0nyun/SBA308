# First Step - Find IDs and store them

- Start with array called learnerIds to store unique IDs.
- Loop through every submission in the LearnerSubmissions list. (reminder that each submission is an individual learners data for that submission)
- Get the learnerâ€™s ID from each submission and store as variable currentId
- Check if this ID is already in learnerIds by running second loop. if found/true code stops.
- If the ID is not found/false, add it to learnerIds. this is so there isnt any duplicate IDs stored.
